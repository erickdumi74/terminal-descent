# ðŸš€ Terminal Descent

**A tiny but tense lunar lander game built in under 150 lines of Python.**  

Land your craft safely on an uncharted celestial body â€” with limited fuel, merciless gravity, and no autopilot.

## ðŸ“œ About the Game

**Terminal Descent** is a minimalist take on the classic lunar lander concept, created for quick fun and easy tinkering.  

Built entirely in Python, it keeps the core tension of landing a fragile craft while stripping away unnecessary complexity.  
Perfect for newcomers to Python game coding â€” or anyone wanting to sharpen reflexes in the terminal.

Features:
- Three difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Selectable gravity settings
- Simple, replayable gameplay loop
- Under 150 lines of code

## ðŸ•¹ How to Play

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+** installed on your system
- A terminal or command prompt

### Run the Game
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/erickdumi74/terminal-descent.git
cd terminal-descent

# Run it
python terminal_descent.py
``` 

### Flight Controls
- **Enter a number** â€” amount of thrust to apply this turn  
- **`q`** â€” quit mid-descent  

### Objective
- Manage your fuel and thrust to counter gravity  
- Touch down at a safe speed (**â‰¤ 5 m/s**)  
- Run out of altitude at high speed and youâ€™ll crater  

### Tips
- Harder modes start you falling faster with less fuel  
- Small thrust adjustments can save precious fuel  
- Watch both speed and altitude â€” the ground comes quick
